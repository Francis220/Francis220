# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Francis, a software engineer from Pittsburgh.

I'm primarily interested in full-stack development and currently work as a software engineer.

Throughout my career, I have been drawn to projects that make a significant impact on a large scale. I've had the privilege of working on industry-leading services and applications with over 100 million installations. My contributions have included developing and launching major features, as well as automating systems in high-traffic, customer-facing consoles.
